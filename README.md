<h1>Description of application</h1>
Happy Cow Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, they can choose if the burger has been 'devoured 'or 'yet to be devoured'. Depending on their choice, the burger will appear on the left or right side of the screen. They can also switch between sides by choosing "Devour it!" or "Make again!".

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

<br>
 Enjoy!
